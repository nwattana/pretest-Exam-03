#GNL

- wish for luck lol
- need check for strjoin
- bewere for NULL-terminate when create string
- Read subject carefully

## case
- \n at BUFFERSIZE
- EOF at BUFFERSIZE
- no Remaining static
- Last read
- after last read
- How to know last read
- Use Struct better

## NOT PASS ;( at first try  
- case big file 10000 kb


# Probelm
- newline when end of file
- if file have must have
- if file dont have no need Why ?
- End of file will Show value = 0;
- Read more that file
- just a sigle newline
- just a sigle char no newline with BUFFER_SZE more than 1


- care if read continue read even endof file reach
- read will read even end of file so Use the return value to protect it in append
